## Purpose
Sports analytics have been gaining traction over the last several years to support improved decision making. This can include insight into team building, tactics, and game preparation. For this assessment I aquired a large collection of spatio-temporal data on soccer (football) matches in five top-flight professional leagues in Europe. This data includes a record for every on-field event during each game througout the season. Events include features such as passes, fouls, shots, duels, and touches.
